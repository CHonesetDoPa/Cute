We can use the following command in the terminal (Windows uses win+R to bring up the Cmd run box) to see the version of Cute we are using：

For most programming languages, the first introductory programming code is "Hello World!" , but that's not cute enough, so our first programming code is "I'm Cute!", and the following code outputs "I'm Cute!" using Cute：

Cute.csc File Code：

    #!/usr/bin/cute
    print("I'm Cute!");

Cute common file extension is .csc (Cute Source Code), which is the source code file format of Cute.

The format of the encapsulated resource is .cbrf (Cute Binary Run File)

You can save the above code in the cute.csc file and execute it with the Cute command (immediate execution mode).

    $ cute Cute.csc

The output of the above command is:

    I'm Cute!
